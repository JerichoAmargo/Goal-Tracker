# To-Do List App

## Description of the Project

    Staying organized and handling our work efficiently has become more important than ever in today's fast-paced environment. With so many obligations to manage, it can be difficult to keep track of everything without a dependable system in place. Enter the To-Do List app, a digital productivity application that aims to improve task management and productivity. 

    In a world of continual distractions and rising demands on our time, a To-Do List app emerges as a vital ally in the search of productivity and organization. Its features, which include task creation and organization, task management capabilities, reminders and notifications,Â and sorting and filtering choices, combine to provide individuals with a strong task management solution. Users can improve their productivity, reduce stress, and fulfill their goals with greater ease by using a To-Do List app.

    The To-Do List app doesn't directly solve healthcare access or disease problems, but it indirectly contributes to SDG 3 by promoting well-being. It helps reduce stress, manage time better, encourage healthy habits, and improve productivity. By supporting personal well-being, the app contributes to the larger goal of promoting a healthier lifestyle for all.
